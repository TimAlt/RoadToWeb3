# RoadToWeb3

Players can gain access to different characters by owning certain NFTs on the Polygon Network.

I used the Unity game engine to create the project. It's a WebGL build that allows users to play in the browser. The NFTs were created on the Polygon network using NFTPort's API. I am connecting to the blockchain using Moralis' javascript API.

If you would like to try the current build, it is in the Cygnus Zero folder.
